# Installation of wireshark	

You can install a PPA package that provides Wireshark 1.8.2 to 12.04 rather than compiling from source. The latest wireshark version is 1.8.4 and the latest in the Ubuntu 12.04 repositories is 1.6.7. The following provides instruction for installing wireshark 1.8.2

To install the PPA, run the following commands:

> sudo add-apt-repository ppa:eugenesan/ppa

> sudo apt-get update

> sudo apt-get install wireshark

### To start Wireshark, run the command sudo wireshark

## Note: It is necessary to run the application as sudo since one needs elevated privileges in order to have access to the raw network stack.
